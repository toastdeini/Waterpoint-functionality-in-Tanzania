## Overview

## Problem

About 4 million of Tanzania's 59 million people lack access to potable (drinking) water; an even greater proportion of the Tanzanian population (nearly half) lack access to what water.org calls "[improved sanitation](https://water.org/our-impact/where-we-work/tanzania/)".

## Data

Data for this project comes from an ongoing competition hosted by DrivenData, [*Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table*](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), which uses data from **Taarifa** and the **Tanzanian Ministry of Water**. Descriptions of each column in the dataset can be found at [this link](data_dict_basic.txt) within this repository.

## Methods

pandas was used for data wrangling and modification; scikit-learn's various libraries and classes were used in preprocessing the data & formulating models.
